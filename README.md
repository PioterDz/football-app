## Project

It's very simple app using React features to get football teams stats. It provides data from `API-FOOTBALL` hosted by `RAPID API` website.

## Setup

To connect with API you need to setup `.env` file in your project's `dir`, like:\
`REACT_APP_API_KEY=...your RapidApi key...`\
`REACT_APP_API_HOST=api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com`\
You can get your own rapidapi key for free in `https://rapidapi.com`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
